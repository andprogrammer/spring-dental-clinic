## Dental Clinic – Spring Boot API

This project is a simple Spring Boot REST API for managing patients in a dental clinic.
The application identifies patients who require a dental visit if their last visit was six months ago or earlier.
It uses Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and an H2 in-memory database.
